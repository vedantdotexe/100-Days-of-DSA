### 🟢 Day 4: March 1, 2026
**Topic:** Array Reversal & Two-Pointer Logic
**Vibe:** 🔄 Reversing the Grid

After taking a quick pit stop to recover from feeling unwell, I’m back in the seat for Day 4. Today was all about reversing an array "In-Place." It’s a classic problem where the easy way (creating a second array) is actually the "lazy" way because it wastes memory. I wanted to learn the professional approach.

The big "Aha!" moment for me was the Two-Pointer technique. I set a 'start' pointer at the beginning and an 'end' pointer at the finish line, then swapped their values using a 'temp' variable—like using a third cup to swap the contents of two others. I kept moving them toward the middle until they met. It was satisfying to see the entire grid flip without using any extra memory (O(1) Space Complexity). It’s a simple shift in thinking that makes the code much more efficient for real-world apps where memory actually matters.
