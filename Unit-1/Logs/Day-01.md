### 🟢 Day 1: February 25, 2026
**Topic:** Linear Search & Big O Foundations
**Vibe:** 🏎️ The Starting Grid

Today was the official start of the engine. I spent the day getting my head around Big O Notation, which basically measures how "expensive" code becomes as data grows. I implemented a Linear Search, the most straightforward way to find something by checking every item one by one. I learned that this is called O(n) complexity because if I have a million items, I might have to take a million steps. 

The big "Aha!" moment for me was realizing that even a simple loop can become a massive bottleneck if the data gets too big. It's the first time I've really thought about code performance instead of just making it work. I also spent some time fixing up my GitHub profile with a Red Bull theme—it took some troubleshooting with the stats links, but I found a mirror server that looks great. Ready to see how arrays handle memory tomorrow.
