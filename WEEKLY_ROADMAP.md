# 🏁 100 Days of DSA: The Strategy 🔵🔴🟡

> **"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."** — Harold Abelson

This repository tracks my daily progress from absolute zero to advanced DSA. My goal is to understand the "Why" behind the code, focusing on high-performance logic for MERN and AI applications.
